# Peg-Game

A peg solitaire game - with javascript on canvas element.

Just clone the repo and load the HTML page to play.

Move all pegs from one side to the other.

Rules:

- Can only move along the lines.
- Green can only move towards the left, red can only move towards the right.
- Can move dirctly to empty hole.
- Can hop over one peg of other color to an empty hole.

Playable but unfinished.

Still to do:

- Make responsive (instead of hardcoded canvas size).
- Reset button.
- Instructions.
- Tell player when out of moves.
- Tell player when they won.


Additional possible enhancements:

- When hovering over a peg, highlight it and its valid move (if one exists)
- When hovering over a peg of a color, add arrows showing the valid move direction
- Sound - for invlid move, valid move, out of moves and win 
- Add other similar game boards

Pull requests welcome :)
