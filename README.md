# Peg-Game

A peg solitaire game - with javascript on canvas element.

Move all pegs from one side to the other.

Legal moves - move dirctly to empty hole.
Hop over other color to an empty hole.
Can only move along the lines.
Green can only move to the left, red can only move to the right.

Playable but unfinished.

Still to do:

- Make responsive (instead of hardcoded canvas size)
- Reset button
- Instructions
- Tell player when out of moves
- Tell player when they won

Pull requests welcome :)
